# Experiments

This directory holds exploratory prototypes that are not part of the stable baseline API.
They are kept for reference only and may change or disappear between releases.

Contents:
- models/regime_detector.py: early clustering prototype (superseded by src/models/modules_2_regime_detector.py)
- models/spread_model.py: prototype price-spread model

Compatibility shims remain in src/models for backward imports.
